# deezDownload

`deezDownload` is a wrapper around the [deemix](https://pypi.org/project/deemix/) Python executable. Currently, it takes in a songs file based on the `%trackname% - %artistname%` and saves the files in a links file. 

This code **needs** to be re-written. The code is all over the place.

## TODO

- [x] Upload to GitHub
- [ ] Add more song services (Spotify, YouTube...)
- [ ] Make it in a more aesthetic manner (potential TUI?)
- [ ] Make the code very sexy, readable and easy to modify
